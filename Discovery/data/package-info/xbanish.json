This is\nsimilar to xterm\u2019s pointerMode setting, but xbanish works globally in\nthe X11 session.</p>\n<p>unclutter\u2019s -keystroke mode is supposed to do this, but it\u2019s\nbroken[0]. I looked into fixing it, but the unclutter source code is\nterrible, so I wrote xbanish.</p>\n<p>The name comes from ratpoison\u2019s \u201cbanish\u201d command that sends the\ncursor to the corner of the screen.</p>\n</rendered-html>",
