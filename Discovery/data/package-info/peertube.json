PeerTube is not meant to become a huge\nplatform that would centralize videos from all around the world. Rather,\nit is a network of inter-connected small videos hosters. Anyone with a\nmodicum of technical skills can host a PeerTube server, aka an instance.\nEach instance hosts its users and their videos. In this way, every\ninstance is created, moderated and maintained independently by various\nadministrators. You can still watch from your account videos hosted by\nother instances though if the administrator of your instance had\npreviously connected it with other instances.</p>\n</rendered-html>",
