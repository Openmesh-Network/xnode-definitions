It is based on a client-server\narchitecture, loosely comparable to CUPS: A client connects to a server\nto issue outbound jobs, the server then chooses a modem to connect to\nthe receiving fax machine. The server notifies users about their\noutbound jobs as well as about inbound jobs. HylaFAX+ is a fork of\nHylaFAX that \u2013 in general \u2013 contains a superset of the features of\nHylaFAX and produces releases more often. This package contains the\nclient and the server parts of HylaFAX+.</p>\n</rendered-html>",
